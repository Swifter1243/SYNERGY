Press and hold left click to be in slicing mode.

NOTES:

Will look kind of like a circle with either another circle or an axis on it.

Should be cut as close to on the beat as possible.

There will be kind of a (   ) approaching on the note when you're supposed to hit it

Blue = Primary cursor
Pink = Secondary cursor

Axis = Cut through the axis

MIRRORS:

Looks like a white line with some colored glow on it. Pink by default, blue near the cursor.

Press 1 to activate x
Press 2 to activate y
Press 3 to activate xy

There will be timing events where you pass the mirrors at a given time, called "swaps".

Little lines will come in from the corners meeting with the mirror to indicate when to pass.

Mirror spawning events are scrapped, doesn't seem fun to me on further thought.
