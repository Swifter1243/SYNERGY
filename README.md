# SYNERGY

Welcome to SYNERGY!

This is a game I've made for a school project. I've decided to make it public to see what the general public has to say/add to it.

The game is about slicing notes to the beat of music, with 2 cursors!

The game includes an editor which gives you full control over the game's mechanics. If you end up making any levels, please send them my way!

Included is a level called "influx", which is a song created by my friend [kitefield](https://twitter.com/kitefieldmusic). 
He also gave me the footage for the visuals, which I made in after effects!

Looking forward to see what everyone thinks! You can grab a build of the game for FREE from one of the [releases](https://github.com/Swifter1243/SYNERGY/releases).

If you'd like to "buy" the game anyway or just support me, feel free to donate to my [ko-fi!](https://ko-fi.com/swifter) Thank you!!

There's also a [gameplay video](https://youtu.be/Fd0vXJZ2NaA) on my youtube channel :)
